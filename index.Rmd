**Welcome to the ML Ethics Wiki!**

We encourage all readers to open a pull request if they feel that they have something to contribute to the wiki. I'll be sure to review, and get back to it as soon as possible! 

Consider this wiki to be a starting point, the work of creating a comprehensive source for machine learning ethics will be herculean.
